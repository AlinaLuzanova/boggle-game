Check out our live demo [here](https://main--boggle-game-by-anilina.netlify.app/)!

Welcome to our Boggle game implementation! This project brings the classic word game Boggle to life on your screen. Boggle is a word game that features a 4x4 grid filled with letter cubes, each displaying one of six possible letters on their faces. Players compete to construct words from the cubes, using each letter at most once per word. Words should be at least three letters long and must be found in the English dictionary.

## How to Play

1. At the start of the game, 16 letter cubes are randomly placed on a 4x4 grid.
2. Players take turns entering words by tracing a path between neighboring cubes.
3. Words must be a minimum of three letters long, use each cube only once, and be valid English words.
4. After a round, points are awarded based on the length of the words found.
5. The game continues until all cubes have been used or a predetermined time limit is reached.
